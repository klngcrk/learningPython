Write a function that compares masses of the laboratory rats.
Masess of 2 rats are stored in two lists. Each list relates to each rat.
Every rat was weighted once a day. Each element in list is result of that measurement.
Elements in list are sorted chronogically.
Functiion should print day number when second rat was heavier than first one.
